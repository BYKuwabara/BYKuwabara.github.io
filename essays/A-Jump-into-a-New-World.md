## A New World

My first coding experience occurred in my first ICS class, ICS 111 at UH Manoa. I walked to class excited, ready to learn about this concept called coding that allows developers to build applications and software that run the modern world. Little did I know how large and expansive this "concept" really is. It's like a new world. This world has thousands of coding languages, filled with data structures and algorithms used to manipulate or store data. Yet here I was, lost in this world without a map. 

## Exploring This World

The first language I learned was Java, as UH Manoa's ICS 111 class teaches Java. A lot of the information that the professor taught flew over my head, especially since they move very fast. However, the real learning and exploration began in the labs and during assignments/projects. Projects and assignments set a goal, which allowed me to use my critical thinking skills and resources to write the code that can fulfill that project. After the first few assignments, I found coding to be enjoyable. Even though running into bugs or getting stuck at a certain point in the code can get frustrating, the euphoria that washes over me when I complete an assignment is rewarding. As I've progressed through my ICS career at UH Manoa, I have discovered more areas of this world. More coding languages like Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript. More data structures and algorithms like hashmaps and binary search. I am enjoying this journey and look forward to new experiences and knowledge. 

## Future Endeavors 

I have explored only a small area of this world and have many miles to go. I have other interests such as cybersecurity, web development, backend development, and much more. I also have other languages that I need to learn and become more proficient in. I need to begin creating more in-depth projects, collaborate with others on bigger projects, and expand my horizons. I acknowledge that I have a lot more to learn and am excited to do so.
