In 2022 of my senior year in highschool, I made it a goal to win my weight class of 121 lbs at the Hawaii HighSchool Judo State Championships. In order to do so, I had to fight and win my matches in the team tournaments which took place every saturday for two or so months. After doing so, I competed in the Eastern OIA and took 1st place, which seeded my ranking high. Then, I became OIA Champ for the 121 lbs boys weightclass. After a week of preparation and 4 hard fights to the top, I won 1st place in the state in judo at 121 lbs. 

Becoming state champ was a milestone for me because I was able to prove to myself that if I worked hard and stayed disciplined, I can achieve my goals. Getting up early in the morning to run and lift weights, or practicing judo late at night takes discipline, and I can proudly say I did that.  I now use this mindset to mold not only my computer science career, but my life.
