Manoa Menu is a website my team and I created for our final project for ICS 314. It has a landing page/home page that displays the features of the website, a Menu page that displays the menu for Hale Aloha, Gateway Cafe, and Campus Center Food Court. These menus have a dropdown menu for translations in other languages for international students. The menu also has a star component, which allows users the ability to click and like their favorite meals. The Campus Cravings page shows the most popular food items among the three food cafes, showing the amount of likes, location, and attributes. The most popular items are filtered to the top of the page. The location page shows the location of each food court, with google map directions if needed. Lastly, if logged in, the dashboard page shows the food choices of the week, along with recommended items based on food items that other students choose to eat.

In this project, I was responsible for the Campus Cravings page and some frontend aspects of the navbar. The Campus Cravings page fetches data from our database, sorts the items by most liked at the top, and displays the food item name, the image, the location, and attributes.
