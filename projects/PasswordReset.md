PasswordReset is a java program that takes "ICS111" as the default password, then allows the user to reset the password to a new one. The new password must contain certain qualities such as 6 or more characters, no spaces, and contain the characters !, $, or ?. The program will ask the user to retype the new password, ensure they match, then set the new password. 

For this project, I was the lead programmer and only programmer responsible for creating this program. I started with creating the necessary variables that would hold the default password, new password, and retyped new password. I utilized the Scanner class to receive input from the user. I then used a bunch of nested if statements to check the password for the necessary qualities.
